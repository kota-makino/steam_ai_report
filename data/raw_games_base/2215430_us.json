        "notes": "Ghost of Tsushima is an action game set in feudal Japan. Players take the role of Jin Sakai, a samurai risking everything to defend Tsushima from the Mongol invaders pillaging the land. Players travel the Japanese countryside helping civilians and defending them from the Mongol invaders. Frequent sword battles take place in 3rd person melee and ranged combat. Successful attacks can result in dismemberment and decapitation, often accompanied by large blood-splatter effects. Players can also use stealth to take out enemies unseen, with assassination kills. Cinematics and other scenes show other examples of intense violence and gore, including a scene where a civilian is burned alive, a scene showing a person beheaded and the decapitated man’s head held up towards the camera. Red blood can be seen in environments, on clothing, and spraying from successful attacks."
