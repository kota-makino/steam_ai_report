Melvor Idle is a feature-rich, idle/incremental game combining a distinctly familiar feel with a fresh gameplay experience. Maxing 20+ skills has never been more zen. Whether you’re a RuneScape newbie, a hardened veteran, or simply someone looking for a deep but accessible adventure that easily fits around a busy lifestyle, Melvor is an addictive idle experience unlike any other.<br><br>Every skill in this game serves a purpose, interacting with the others in interesting ways.

What strategy will you conjure to achieve maximum skillage?<br><br>It doesn’t just end with Woodcutting, Smithing, Cooking and Farming either – take your finely honed tapping abilities into battle and face off against 100+ monsters using your Melee, Ranged and Magic skills. Conquering brutal dungeons and toppling boisterous bosses has never been quite like this before…<br><br>In addition to over 20 skills to level up, there’s offline progression, cloud save compatibility, an integrated Bank/Inventory system and more!
