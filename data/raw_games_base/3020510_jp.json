It focuses on gaining an immersive experience of playing a military general in the world of the Three Kingdoms.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Rich gameplay:</h2>There are three core battles in this game, namely legion battles, martial arts battles and verbal battles. Among them, legion warfare uses a real-time strategy system to achieve victory by annihilating enemy troops and occupying enemy buildings. Fighting and verbal battles adopt a turn-based card system. In order to improve the performance in the three types of battles, it is necessary to improve the three souls of each general, namely the military soul, the martial soul and the intellectual soul. Accumulating three soul points and learning to equip special souls and skills is the most direct way to prompt combat effectiveness.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Multi-identity experience:</h2>When playing as the lord, you can control all the cities under your command and assign them to governors. Improve the economic balance of each city by executing internal policies. and spent the excess money on army formation and recruitment. Improve your own strength by developing science and technology or implementing specific strategies. When the army forms combat effectiveness, you can launch wars, capture enemy cities, and unify the world.<br><br>When playing the role of a general, you need to accumulate merit and speaking power as much as possible. When promoted to a fifth-rank official, he will be named a prefect and gain command of the city. When you accumulate enough merit to serve as a second-grade officer, you can become a legion commander and add more cities to your legion. You can also use your speaking power to exchange for the direct jurisdiction of more cities when talking to the lord, or to obtain more generals under the lord's army.<br><br>When playing the role of a military general in the field, you can build military residences in the city and form a private army. And sign mercenary contracts with the lords of other forces. When this force encounters a war, you can lead mercenaries to join the war and influence the general trend of the world.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Various social networking:</h2>All generals in the game can be befriended. It is relatively easy to get to know generals with similar personalities, but it is more difficult to get along with those who are noble or have different personalities. There are many benefits to building a good relationship with military generals. In addition to directly obtaining immortal points, you can also ask them to give you special training to quickly increase certain characteristic values.

In addition, when the relationship reaches a certain level, you can become betrothed or married.
