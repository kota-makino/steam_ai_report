Players explore the Nine Realms, battling enemies in close-up, hand-to-hand combat against human-like raiders and fantastical creatures. Players use the Leviathan Axe and the chained Blades of Chaos to battle enemies, with attacks resulting in large sprays of red blood, decapitation, and dismemberment. After weakening an enemy, players can perform finishing moves that depict close-up impalement, dismemberment, and decapitation. Strong Language is used in the dialogue."
